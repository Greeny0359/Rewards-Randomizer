Description=A Simpsons: Hit & Run Rewards Randomiser inspired by KH2 Rando. Find all the Homer 2 Costumes and beat 7-7.\n\nCars or Costumes are given for completing missions and races, and normal purchases excluding costumes are randomized.\n\nYou can warp to any level but story missions can only be done in order (bonus missions and street races can be done at any time) and you cannot progress past missions with forced purchases until you find the item in question. To start 7-5, 7-6 and 7-7 you will need to find Dirty Homer, Evil Homer and Donut Homer respectively.\n\nCurrent Issues: Currently if you swap to a costume that you would not normally get in the level, you will softlock the game upon trying to start a mission. If this happens, Mission Warp and switch your costume back.\n\nCurrent Mod Setting lets you set your seed, multiplier for sold cars (ranges from 0.1x to 10x), whether or not OP Cars (OWRC, MBL and Hearse) are banned, and whether or not popups appear when you get a reward.\n\nIn the future, a setting that allows mission orders within a level to be reversed will be implemented.
